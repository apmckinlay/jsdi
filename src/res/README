The res/ directory contains resource files expected by Suneido stdlib code
because it is available in the cSuneido executable.

Ideally, these files would not be contained in jsdi.dll because they are not
part of the DLL interface per se. The best solution would be to implement a
Suneido-language system for loading resources from the _Suneido_ _database_.
The annoying part is that Windows can only 'load' a resource either from a
loaded module or from file (in general, no obvious easy way to create an
HCURSOR, e.g., from an array of bytes). But we already have a Suneido function
which gets around this by using temp files. See LoadImageFrom().

To bring the resources up-to-date with cSuneido:
    1) suneido.rc:
           (A) Copy suneido.rc from the cSuneido project -> res/suneido.rc
           (B) Delete references to irrelevant resources (ie
               suneido.exe.manifest)
    2) resource.h:
           Copy resource.h from the cSuneido project -> res/resource.h
    3) Individual resource files
           (A) Copy resource files from the cSuneido project -> res/res/*
           (B) Delete irrelevant resources (ie suneido.exe.manifest)
    4) Update the version info block

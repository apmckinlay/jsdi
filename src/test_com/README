This sub-project defines a trivial interface, ITestJSDICom, which can be used
to test jSuneido/JSDI's COMobject functionality.

The architecture is as follows.

    - ITestJSDICom is defined in the IDL file as a 'dual' interface, so that
      midl generates a C++ protocol object containing pure virtual functions
      for each declared property and method.

    - As a 'dual' interface, ITestJSDICom implements IDispatch.

    - ITestJSDICom is implemented by a backing struct called 'TestJSDIComImpl',
      which is defined in test_com.cpp.

    - The struct TestJSDIComImpl implements the "difficult" functions of
      IDispatch by delegating them to existing functions defined in
      oleaut32.dll:
          [ ] Invoke() is delegated to DispInvoke()
          [ ] GetIDsOfNames() is delegated to DispGetIDsOfNameS()

    - In order to do the above delegation, TestJSDIComImpl needs to get a
      pointer to an ITypeInfo interface which has type info about the
      ITestJSDICom interface.

    - The ITypeInfo is supplied by loading a type library (TLB). 

    - In the IDL file, ITestJSDICom is wrapped in a 'library' declaration. This
      causes midl to generate a type library (TLB) file, midl.tlb.

    - The TLB file is included in final binary's resources (i.e. it is a
      TYPELIB resource within jsdi.exe or jsdi.dll).

    - The struct TestJSDIComImpl loads TYPELIB resource using the
      LoadTypeLibEx() function from oleaut32.dll.

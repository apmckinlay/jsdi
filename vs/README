This directory contains Visual Studio solutions for building jsdi.

For example, the folder vs12_nov2013_ctp/ contains the solution and projects for
building jsdi using Visual Studio 12.0 + the Visual C++ November 2013 CTP
(customer technology preview).

To get a particular version working:
    [ ] Ensure your environment has a JAVA_HOME_X86 variable set which points to
        the root of an x86 JDK.
    [ ] Ensure you have the correct Visual Studio and compiler toolchain
        installed.
    [ ] The test executable (jsdi.exe) now uses the JNI invocation API to create
        its own JVM for certain tests. This means that running jsdi.exe now
        requires a jvm.dll. Preferably, ensure your PATH environment variable
        includes $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/client/ or $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/server/.
        Alternatively, you can copy jvm.dll into the executable's local
        directory.

One issue I have had with the November 2013 CTP is building with /MDd or /MTd
(multithread debug DLL or multithread debug exe) doesn't work in certain cases, possibly
because the MS debug STL versions don't adequately implement facets for all character
set types. So as of 20140520, the "Debug-exe" and "Debug-dll" configurations use
/MD and /MT, respectively, which means they don't compile or link against the debug
libraries. TODO: Fix this as soon as MS releases a new Visual Studio version.

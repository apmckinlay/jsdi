This directory contains Visual Studio solutions for building jsdi.

For example, the folder vs12_nov2013_ctp/ contains the solution and projects for
building jsdi using Visual Studio 12.0 + the Visual C++ November 2013 CTP
(customer technology preview).

To get a particular version working:
    [ ] Ensure your environment has a JAVA_HOME_X86 variable set which points to
        the root of an x86 JDK.
    [ ] Ensure you have the correct Visual Studio and compiler toolchain
        installed.
    [ ] The test executable (jsdi.exe) now uses the JNI invocation API to create
        its own JVM for certain tests. This means that running jsdi.exe now
        requires a jvm.dll. Preferably, ensure your PATH environment variable
        includes $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/client/ or $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/server/.
        Alternatively, you can copy jvm.dll into the executable's local
        directory.
